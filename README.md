# FLIM Interactive Data Analysis
This is a graphical user interphase designed for analysis of FLIM data generated by Becker&Hickl TCSPC system (sdt file format). 

Run *.m file, not *.fig file to start GUI.

There are three major GUIs in this package:
1. Run FLIMDataAnalysisGUI to open the main GUI where you can import sdt files.
2. KinetochoreSelectionTool is for kinetochore identification and tracking. This should be opened through the mainGUI if you are analyzing new datasets, but it can also open previously saved sessions.
3. FittingGUI is for FLIM curve fitting using the least-square curve fitting or Bayesian methods. This should be opened through the mainGUI if you are analyzing new datasets, but it can also open previously saved sessions or FIFO files directly.
